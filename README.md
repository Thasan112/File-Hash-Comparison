# File-Hash-Comparison
This project demonstrates how to generate and compare file hash values in Linux using the `sha256sum` command.


## Files

- **file1.txt** – Test file containing sample content.
- **file2.txt** – Another test file with the same content.
- **filehash** – SHA-256 hash value of `file1.txt`.
- **file2hash** – SHA-256 hash value of `file2.txt`.


#Step performed
**List files**

**View files**

**Generate Hash Values**

**View Hash Files**

**Compare the hash values**

**Output**
→ Since both files had identical content, their hashes matched.
